     Attached is a general program, which is named ` EqConsInf '.  It can be used in treating the examples in the following manuscript:

               Solving the Equality-constrained Minimization of Polynomial Functions.
               
The software `Wsolve’ is enclosed herewith.

      This program relies on the computer algebra system MAPLE 15 or others. If you don’t have this system on your computer, you’ll 
need to install it!  For the usage of these programs, please see the attached worksheets.
